This is a test post, I'll put up some meaningful content at a later date. In general, expect to find random interesting facts on the JavaScript world, updates on some of my personal projects, and some opinions about random things I read or heard about. Basically, its a blog.

{% highlight javascript %}
describe("Testing Jekyll", function() {
	it("can syntax highlight", function() {
		expect(success).to.be.ok
	})
});
{% endhighlight %}
